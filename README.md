 This is just a silly little passphrase generator that I made to
 both entertain myself as well as solve a recurring issue that
 I have with a LARP group I associate with - hence the medieval
 theme.

 Usage is simple enough - just download the script and the Codex
 Vocabulum (or supply your own) and run it.

 Tested against Python 3.11.6.
